### Fifa-21-Data-Analysis
The FIFA 21 Data Analysis project aims to analyze and visualize the player statistics from FIFA 21. This project provides insights into player performance, attributes, and potential using various data analysis techniques and visualization tools.  



## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the FIFA 21 dataset using Python. The goal is to gain insights into player attributes, performance metrics, and other relevant statistics. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and various analytical techniques to understand the dataset comprehensively.

## Project Structure

- Data Collection: Importing the FIFA 21 dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing EDA to gain initial insights.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to represent the data.
- Advanced Analysis: Applying advanced analytical techniques to derive deeper insights.
- Reporting: Summarizing the findings in a comprehensive report.


## Data Collection

Steps

1. Data Source: The FIFA 21 dataset can be obtained from various sources such as Kaggle in csv Format.
2. Import Data: Import the dataset into Python using libraries like pandas.

python
import pandas as pd

 Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('fifa21.csv')


 ## Data Preprocessing

 Steps

1. Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle 
missing values in the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, and format data types.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features that may be useful for analysis.

python
 Handling missing values
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

 Data cleaning
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

 Feature engineering example
df['BMI'] = df['weight_kg'] / (df['height_cm'] / 100)  2


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Steps

1. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and mode.
2. Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between different attributes.
3. Distribution Analysis: Analyze the distribution of key attributes.
python
 Descriptive statistics
print(df.describe())

 Correlation analysis
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
print(correlation_matrix)

 Distribution analysis
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(df['overall_rating'], kde=True)
plt.show()


## Data Visualization

 Steps

1. Bar Charts: Visualize categorical data.
2. Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numerical data.
3. Scatter Plots: Visualize relationships between two numerical variables.
4. Heatmaps: Visualize correlation matrices.
 Scatter plot example
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='overall_rating', data=df)
plt.show()

 Heatmap example
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()


## Advanced Analysis

 Steps

1. Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms to group similar players.
2. Regression Analysis: Predict player performance metrics.
3. Classification: Classify players into different 

categories based on attributes.

python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

 Clustering example
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(df[['overall_rating', 'potential']])

 Regression analysis example
X = df[['age', 'potential', 'value_eur']]
y = df['overall_rating']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)



## Recommendations

1. Data Augmentation:
   - Additional Features: Incorporate additional features such as player positions, clubs, and leagues to enhance analysis.
   - Temporal Analysis: Analyze player performance over different seasons to identify trends.

2. Advanced Modeling:
   - Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Deep Learning: Explore deep learning techniques for more complex analyses.
3. Interactive Dashboards:
   - Real-Time Updates: Implement real-time data updates for the dashboard.
   - User Interactivity: Enhance user interactivity with more filters and options.


## Limitations

1. Data Quality:
   - Incomplete Data: Missing or incomplete player data can affect the accuracy of the analysis.
   - Data Freshness: Outdated data may not reflect current player performance.

2. Model Assumptions:
   - Linear Relationships: Some models assume linear relationships between variables, which may not always be the case.
   - Overfitting: Complex models may overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization.

3. Scalability:
   - Large Datasets: Handling very large datasets may require
